    We develop imaging methods and computational approaches to identify and
    characterize cells in the context of intact tissues and tumors with a focus
    on molecular mechanisms of disease progression and therapeutic response.

# Navigating Spatial Biology 

The Harvard Tissue Atlas is a collection of molecular and physical maps of
tissues and tumors that promise to fundamentally advance biology research. The
overall aim of the atlas is to better understand the transition from normal to
diseased states as well as response to therapy in order to better detect and
prevent disease and enhance precision-medicine treatment. An international team
of researchers, clinicians, and software engineers combine the genetic
information from single-cell sequencing methods with morphological and spatial
transcriptomics from highly-multiplexed imaging methods. By deeply profiling the
molecular and phenotypic properties of tissues and tumors from mouse models to
patients enrolled in novel clinical trials, the atlas promises to improve our
understanding of the complex cellular interactions in normal and diseased
tissue.

The Harvard Tissue Atlas encompasses multiple collaborative projects,
international consortia and disease areas. The Atlas is based in the Laboratory
of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) at Harvard Medical School.
