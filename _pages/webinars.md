# Multiplex Tissue Imaging Technology Series

A major challenge to precision medicine is our incomplete understanding of biological activity at the single cell level within complex healthy and diseased tissue architectures. The Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) is developing a new generation of highly multiplex imaging and other spatial profiling techniques to acquire precise molecular information from intact histological specimens in order to better understand disease progression and therapeutic response. The resulting data are freely shared through the open access Harvard Tissue Atlas (HTA), a data portal that allows the users to discover and explore high-resolution multiplex tissue images for research and educational purposes.  

This multi-episode series introduces the major components of the multiplex tissue imaging pipeline used to create the HTA. We showcase the voices of the scientists in the LSP who are developing and using quantitative tissue imaging technologies to advance our understanding of disease pathology and improve clinical therapies. Each episode focuses on one link in the pipeline, including methods and software used in tissue sample preparation, image acquisition, quantitative image and spatial molecular data analysis, online collaboration, data sharing, and science education.

## Intro to the Curriculum

Welcome to the multiplexed tissue imaging technology series! This webinar series will provide unique insight into the active multiplex tissue imaging pipeline used to create the HTA. The goal of these talks is to introduce members of the scientific community to our pipelines in the hope of inspiring collaboration, method sharing, and innovation.  

### Overview of Multiplex Tissue Imaging

HTA is a molecular and physical map of human tissues and tumors. Multiplex imaging is the key method for developing these maps - it captures spatially resolved genomic, proteomic, and metabolic data at a single-cell level while preserving tissue architecture and context.  

### Specimen and Experiment Management: Collection, Archiving and Tracking

Specimens, reagents, projects, and experiments are tracked internally using custom Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) databases built by LSP software engineers. Reagent Tracker and Experiment Tracker are evolving resources that anchor robust metadata and sample tracking pipelines and facilitate collaboration throughout the experimental life cycle.

### MITI: Minimum Information about Tissue Imaging

Inconsistent data annotation is a major barrier to collaboration, data reuse and research reproducibility. To address this problem, the LSP in collaboration with the Human Tumor Atlas Network, developed MITI reporting guidelines to provide clinical, biospecimen, and experimental metadata standards for most multiplexed imaging technologies.

### Antibody validation and antibody panel design

Meaningful data from tissue imaging relies on having high-quality antibodies and carefully designed antibody panels. The LSP extensively validates antibodies, rates antibody performance, and custom builds antibody panels for each project to answer clinically-relevant questions.  

### t-CyCIF method

Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence, or t-CyCIF, is the multiplex imaging method developed within the LSP that can be used to measure the distribution of dozens of proteins in intact tissue specimens. This iterative process collects repeated immunofluorescent images from the same sample using different fluorescent-tagged antibodies in each cycle and then assembles these images into a high-dimensional representation of the tissue.  

### High resolution and 3D imaging

HTA contributes to the collective understanding of physiology and pathology across many scales. Imaging at higher resolution can highlight striking subcellular features, such as the arrangement of organelles, that can be used to characterize diseases. On the other end of the scale, thick tissues can be imaged in 3D by optical or serial sectioning to better describe the intricate ways cells interact in their native tissue context.

### OMERO

Tissue imaging projects at the LSP are multi-disciplinary and encourage cross-institutional partnerships. To enable this collaboration, we use OMERO for large image file management, viewing, analysis and online collaboration.  

### MCMICRO: Multiple-Choice Microscopy Pipeline

Reproducible analysis of large multichannel images poses a substantial computational challenge. MCMICRO is a modular and open-source computational pipeline that addresses this challenge by offering powerful end-to-end processing while maintaining the flexibility of using user-selected modules.  

### SCIMAP: Spatial Single-cell Analysis Toolkit

t-CyCIF enables detailed molecular analysis of single cells by preserving spatial context between imaging cycles. SCIMAP is a Python-based toolkit to perform single-cell analysis on t-CyCIF images. With a wide range of capabilities, including pre-processing, phenotyping, clustering and spatial analysis, SCIMAP efficiently deals with large datasets of millions of cells.

### Data Visualization and Sharing â€“ MINERVA and Scope2Screen

Science succeeds as a collaborative process. In the adjacent fields of multiplex tissue imaging and digital pathology, there is need to both share processed and annotated results from imaging and incentivize open access to raw data. MINERVA and Scope2Screen are software tools developed at the LSP for image visualization and data sharing in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles.  

### Integrating Spatial Transcriptomics with Imaging

Spatial transcriptomics uses spatially-resolved mRNA readouts to assign cell phenotypes to histological sections. Combining spatial transcriptomics with multiplex tissue imaging reveals hidden relationships between single cell genomics and histological presentations in the tissue.
