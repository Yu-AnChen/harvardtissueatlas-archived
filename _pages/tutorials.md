## Highly Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging of Human Tissues and Tumors Using t-CyCIF and Conventional Optical Microscopes
CyCIF is a robust and inexpensive method for highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging using standard instruments and reagents. The concept of repeatedly staining and imaging slides has been around for many years and most commonly involves antibody stripping using denaturants. Gerdes et al (2013) described an approach in which fluorophores are chemically inactivated after each of several rounds of immunofluorescence. The t-CyCIF method by Lin et al (2018) builds on this and related approaches. The rich data collected using CyCIF are also amenable to state-of-the-art, high-dimensionality analysis tools developed for CyTOF, including tSNE , viSNE and Wanderlust. These allow investigation of complex associations and interdependencies between observed features and phenotypes.

CyCIF (Tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence) uses formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and tissue specimens mounted on glass slides. These are the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates multiplexed images of FFPE samples using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high dimensional representation. Several variants are possible using direct and indirect immunofluorescence.

## Minerva Author and Story
Minerva is a suite of software tools for tissue atlases and digital pathology that enables interactive viewing and fast sharing of large image data. It comprises of Minerva Author, a tool that lets you easily create and annotate images, and Minerva Story, a narrative image viewer for web hosting.
