Zoltan Maliga is a senior research scientist in the LSP who is responsible for performing high-plex single cell imaging of FFPE embedded samples using t- CyCIF and managing collaborations with industrial partners including ReadCoor and Rarecyte. Maliga obtained his PhD in 2014 from the Biophysics program at Harvard University working under the supervision of Tim Mitchison on use of X-ray crystallography and protein biochemistry to define the mechanism of a novel class of anti-cancer drugs. He undertook his postdoctoral training with Anthony Hyman at the MPI-CBG in Dresden, Germany on mitosis and cell type specification. Maliga has broad expertise in cell biology, imaging, and proteomic methods. He is responsible for the smooth operation of the t-CyCIF imaging platform and for testing and introducing new methods and technologies. In the current proposal he plays a leading in role in testing and qualifying new antibodies and enabling sample processing.
