Dr. Yapp is an expert in image analysis and informatics for HTAN in the LSP focusing on using machine learning methods for image segmentation. Dr. Yapp obtained his MSc and DPhil from the University of Oxford, England in 2007 and 2011, respectively, in the labs of Professor Udo Oppermann and Professor Alison Noble. There, he developed an image-based analysis pipeline for identifying induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colonies. During his postdoctoral studies under Dr. Susanne Muller-Knapp at the Structural Genomics Consortium and Target Discovery Institute in Oxford, UK, Yapp pioneered and automated two image-based cellular assays for identifying over 20 potent small molecule chemical probes for validating novel epigenetic targets. Having managed microscopy facilities since 2011 and being exposed to a highly interdisciplinary background, he advises on experimental design and working with PIs to solve problems that span across wet-lab work, data acquisition, and analysis. In addition to overseeing image collection, Dr. Yapp assists with analytical methods including approaches to segmentation of TMA images.
